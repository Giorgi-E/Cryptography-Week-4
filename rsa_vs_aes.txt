
All encryptions were done via terminal commands using openssl.

RSA is asymmetric and uses a public/private key pair. 
It is suitable for encryption of smaller data and needs secure sharing of AES keys.
RSA encryption is slower and more CPU-intensive.

AES is symmetric and uses only one shared secret key.
It is suitable for encryption of larger files and is very fast.
AES encruption is more efficient for encryption in bulk.
