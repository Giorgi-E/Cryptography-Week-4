Handshake begins with Client Hello message which contains TLS version, cipher suite info and a random nonce.
The server then replies with Server Hello that includes the chosen cipher suite, certification, server key exchange and session ticket.
Then the key exchange is done and both client and server gain access to the shared key, which is used to establish secure communication.

MITM protection mechanisms
Server sends the certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, guaranteeing its authenticity. 
Because of public key cryptography only the server can decrypt the pre-master secret.
Even if someone were to intercept communication between server and client they would be unable to decrypt the data without the private key.

TLS application in websites
When visiting a HTTPS website the browser initiates the TLS handshake. The data is then encrypted between the browser(client) and server.
The server verifies its identity via the certificate therefore ensuring Authentication.
The encrypted data ensures Confidentiality and makes it so that the data cannot be tampered with ensuring Integrity.
